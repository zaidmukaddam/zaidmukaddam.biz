## Introducing Mini Feed - The one-stop shop for content you love

Hello, beautiful people. I'm very happy and excited to introduce Mini Feed, the one stop shop for content you love.

## The Story Behind Mini Feed
I've been practicing digital minimalism for some time now. Some days, I even refrain from using the Internet altogether. In my quest for digital minimalism, I often missed out on the content I truly enjoy, which sometimes made me break the digital minimalism rules and spend hours surfing the web. You all know how distracting and noisy the internet can be.

As I searched for solutions to this situation, I found few digital tools to assist in the process. However, the satisfaction you get when you make your own solution is unbeatable. So I decided to create my own app to stay up to date with the content and people that interest me without being distracted or spending more time.
